### What I learned

I used the challenge to practice implementing transitions for element properties. My goal was to give the Cancel button a border and to increase the opacity of the font when in the hover/focus state. I didn't love the way it looked when the border just popped into existence, and I knew I could use a transition to ease in the change. That fixed my issue with the border, but then the change in font opacity became a little too jarring in contrast to the border transition. I figured that it was possible to apply multiple transtions to a single element, but I wasn't exacly sure what the correct syntax was. It only took a few minutes of trial and error to get to the answer. I'm incredibly happy with how it turned out!

### Continued development

Doing layouts has been one of my biggest struggles with CSS. I'm super proud of my solution to tackling the layout of this component, particularly the bit with the subscription cost and the "change" link in the middle. But I know that there are certainly far more efficient approaches, and I can already see where my approach would start to become really clunky if the design required a different layout for larger screen sizes.
